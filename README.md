MIE438 Project
====================

This project was built and submitted as part of mie438: microprocessors and embedded microcontrollers in the third year of engsci robo.

- we solve the classic inverted pendulum problem using an imu sensor and pid controller
- the system is built on the esp platform and used the esp-idf for development (we just forked the template)

# ESP-IDF template app

This is a template application to be used with [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).
